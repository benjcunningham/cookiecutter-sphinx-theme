This is a `Cookiecutter <https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter>`_ template for
creating a custom Sphinx theme based on the ubiquitous `Read the Docs theme
<https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.

Quickstart
==========

Install the latest Cookiecutter, preferably with Homebrew:

.. code:: bash

    brew install cookiecutter

Then bake your new project and follow the on-screen prompts:

.. code:: bash

    cookiecutter https://github.com/benjcunningham/cookiecutter-sphinx-theme.git

Finalize plugin setup by:

- Changing directories into the project
- Initializing the Git repo with ``git init``
- Creating a remote on GitHub
- Setting the remote URL with ``git remote set-url origin``
